## üìí An open ledger designed to register scam wallets
This ledger is accessible to the general community and developers alike. Our primary objective is to establish a straightforward mechanism for registering scam wallets and subsequently denying them access to services. By successfully accomplishing this, we aim to make life more challenging for scammers in the future. 
</br> 
</br>
The most impactful aspect of this database is its potential integration with Centralized Crypto Exchanges, rendering it virtually impossible for scammers to transfer stolen funds from Cardano into fiat currencies.
